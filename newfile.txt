Difference between add, commit and push

If you use "add" command it will stage all or specific files that have changes depends on your selection.

If you use "commit" it will save changes locally

However if you use "push" command it will share changes to other people, basically pushing it to your repo so that other members of the project can view/review the changes of your code
